# What next?

After this brief 1-hr workshop, we hope that you feel a bit more oriented with the Pangeo community and the abundance of great open-access resources available to you!

In particular, we hope that you've seen the potential for utilizing Xarray and Dask on scalable Cloud-hosted infrastructure for your own research. Please continue to engage with the community on the [Pangeo Discourse Forum!](https://discourse.pangeo.io)

Thanks for attending!
